Get started by verifying the readiness of your operational environment, login, network access, and web browser.

To use the Operational resiliency service, you should ensure that your environment meets all requirements. 

* Your environment must meet all BlueXP requirements including a login and network access from a web browser.

Refer to the BlueXP https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-checklist-cm.html[Getting started checklist]

* The service requires that all clusters are monitored by Digital Advisor (formerly Active IQ Digital Advisor). Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/index.html[Digital Advisor documentation].

* You need to have access credentials to the clusters. 

* While not a requirement, it is helpful if the BlueXP Connector is in place and enabled and the ONTAP system is discovered. If not, the Operational resiliency service walks you through those processes. 

== Supported web browsers

The BlueXP Operational resiliency service supports recent versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome with a minimum resolution of 1280 x 720.
